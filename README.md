## Introduction

This repo contains functions and simulations used in C. Siu, G. Samorodnitsky, C. Yu, and R. He, The Asymptotics of the Expected Betti Numbers of Preferential Attachment Clique Complexes, 2023. The arxiv link can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11259).

We use Ripser to investigate the topological properties of the clique complex of the preferential attachment model. We determine the asymptotic growth rates of the expected Betti numbers, their upper bound and lower bound.



## Requirement
write later

## Code
1. 'simulator_pa.py' contains functions to generate a peferential attachment model using iGraph
2. 'betti.py' contains functions to measure the topological features of a complex
3. 'tutorial.ipynb' is a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the simulations used in the paper.
